,"JACKSON, Miss. (AP) — The Latest on President Donald Trump's visit to Mississippi for the opening of museums dedicated to the state's history and its role in the civil rights movement (all times local): 1:45 p.m. During the opening ceremony for two museums in Mississippi, about 25 people, black and white, stood silently with Confederate battle flag stickers covering their mouths. They were protesting that the emblem is still part of the Mississippi state flag. President Donald Trump visited Saturday for the opening of the museums, dedicated to the state's history and its role in the civil rights movement, and spoke to a select audience. He left before the public ceremony. The flag protest was led by Mississippi actress Aunjanue Ellis, who said having the Confederate emblem on the flag is ""insulting to the people they claim they're honoring"" in the civil rights museum. Mississippi is the last state with a flag that includes the Confederate emblem. A bid to change the flag was defeated in a 2001 referendum. --- 12:00 p.m. In paying tribute to civil rights activists in Mississippi, President Donald Trump says ""we strive to be worthy of their sacrifice"" and ""pray for inspiration from their example."" He was speaking at the opening of two museums in Jackson, an event boycotted by some black leaders, including civil rights leader and Georgia congressman John Lewis. Jackson Mayor Chokwe Lumumba also stayed away from Saturday's ceremonies, citing Trump's ""pompous disregard"" for the values embodied by the civil rights movement. Trump did not address the controversy in his remarks to assembled guests, but spoke of paying ""solemn tribute to our heroes of the past"" and dedicating ourselves to ""building a future of freedom, equality, justice and peace.""
